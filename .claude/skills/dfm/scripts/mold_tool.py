"""Fact-only injection-molding geometry measurements for mesh files.

Reports measurements as JSON. It never emits pass/fail, verdicts, or
moldability statuses; comparisons against resin, texture and tooling limits
belong to the skill workflow using `references/injection-molding.md`.

Requires: trimesh, numpy, rtree (pip install -r requirements.txt)

Usage:
    python mold_tool.py measure <mesh> --pull z [--units mm] [--wall-limit 45] [--zero-tol 0.05]
    python mold_tool.py pulls <mesh> [--units mm] [--wall-limit 45] [--zero-tol 0.05]

`measure` reports three fact families for one pull axis: draft, undercut
candidates, and projection. `pulls` repeats the draft and undercut summaries
for x, y, z and the mesh's own principal axes. Wall thickness is NOT measured
here; use `$dfam-check`'s `measure` for it, and ignore its `max_mm`, which
reads a plate's length rather than its thickness.

Draft is measured per triangle as the angle between the face and the pull
axis: 0 means the face is parallel to the pull (no draft), 90 means it is
perpendicular to it (a top or bottom face). Faces at or above `--wall-limit`
from the pull axis are not counted as walls. A flat face is pooled by normal
and read exactly; a CURVED face is pooled by the surface it lies on and read at
the 5th percentile of that surface's area, because a facet of a curved face is
a chord and chords scatter -- `spread_deg` reports that scatter and bounds how
far low the reading can be. A curved face merely TANGENT to the pull is
reported apart from a flat zero-draft wall because its area is a tessellation
artifact.
Which mold half forms a face, whether a parting line makes it an undercut, and
side actions are not determined here. The undercut family is a straight-pull
occlusion test: a face whose withdrawal ray is blocked by the part itself is
reported as a candidate.

If a fact family fails, the report carries `"partial": true`, names the family
in `partial_sections`, and the command exits 2, so neither a JSON reader nor a
shell caller can take a partial report for a complete one.

    261 mm2 coarse, 67 mm2 fine, for the same sphere. A cylinder's wall, by
    contrast, is parallel to the pull over its whole area and is a real
    zero-draft wall.

    What separates them is what the surface does on either side: at a tangent
    line it passes THROUGH parallel, so the region has smoothly-joined
    neighbours leaning both ways. Across a sharp edge (a box corner, a cap)
    the surface is a different face, so only smooth joins are followed.

    That test alone is not enough, because a fillet joins a wall smoothly too:
    a flange rim with a radius top and bottom has leaning neighbours both ways
    and is still a real zero-draft wall. What separates those is SIZE: a band
    standing in for a tangent line is one step of the same sweep as the facets
    bounding it, so it reaches about as far along the pull as they do, where a
    wall reaches many times further.

    The unit that gets measured is the whole zero-draft REGION -- every
    zero-draft face reachable through smooth joins -- not one triangle of it.
    A flat wall is split into rows by nothing but the export's tolerance, and
